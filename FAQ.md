# FAQ

## What is OER?
'OER' stands for 'Open Educational Resources' and refers to freely accessible materials that can be used for a [range of activities around teaching and learning](https://www.opencontent.org/definition/). What makes them open is that they are typically published with an open license instead of a traditional copyright license. One key feature of OER is that they afford new opportunities for collaboration and innovation in teaching and learning.

According to the [UNESCO definition](http://www.unesco.org/new/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/HQ/CI/CI/pdf/Events/English_Paris_OER_Declaration.pdf), OER are “teaching, learning and research materials in any medium, digital or otherwise, that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.”

Following the definition by [The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation](http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources) OER can be (or include) full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.

Although comprehensive definitions like these are well-known, the detail of how to arrive at a final definition for OER remains debated. The OER World Map project takes a broad and inclusive approach, providing information about actors and activities from the field of OER in the strict sense of the term, but also about related subjects like Open Education, Open Access and MOOCs. For more information on our collection strategy, please see “What belongs on the OER World Map?”

## Who is this website for?
The OER World Map provides helpful information for everyone who is interested in or connected to OER and Open Education. The system is designed to provide real-time answers to questions like:
- "Where can I find OER?"
- "Which projects are working on a similar topic to our project?"
- "Which experts have the knowledge to answer a question related to a special area of OER?"

We believe that this set of data is of special importance, since it provides a solid foundation for future attempts to collect knowledge about OER and Open Education in a systematic way.

Our platform provides relevant data and information to all stakeholder groups from the field of OER. This diversity provides a major challenge for system design since user oriented interfaces are typically informed by the clearly defined needs of user types.

At the moment, we focus on three main use cases (or "epics"):
- Teachers and learners should be provided with qualified lists of OER services (e.g. repositories of OER) in order to help them finding resources more efficiently;
- OER actors should be supported in their communication and collaboration through  connecting to relevant OER experts and projects working on similar tasks
- OER Policy makers should be supported by reliable statistical data.

In addition to browser access (on desktop and mobile) The OER World Map makes data available to other systems through an Application Programming Interface (API), which will allow other services to reuse our data easily.

Our use - which are used to design the services we provide - cases are collected on [GitHub](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Astory). If you think anything is missing here, please [contact us](mailto:info@oerworldmap.org)!

## How can I participate?
The success of the project is dependent on the participation of the OER community.  There are many ways to contribute. The most important ways are:

- Collecting and entering data using our input templates
- Contributing ‘stories’
- Becoming a ‘country champion’

There are many other ways of contributing to the project. A complete overview can be found [here](https://oerworldmap.org/contribute).

## How can I input and edit data?
To be able to enter data, you only have to register yourself to the OER World Map. You can find further information on how to use our input templates in our [wiki here](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/wiki/FAQs-for-OER-World-Map-editors).

## What belongs on the OER World Map?
The OER World Map collects data about actors and activities related to OER and Open Education. At the moment we concentrate on elements of the OER infrastructure. We are particularly interested in:

<table class="table">
<tr> <th>Data type</th><th>Definition</th> <th>Examples</th></tr>
<tr> <td>organizations</td><td>An organization is a steady group of people sharing collective goals. The spectrum reaches from fully incorporated legal persons on the one hand to loosely connected communities on the other.</td> <td>universities, corporations, associations, communities</td></tr>
<tr> <td>projects</td><td>A project is a temporary undertaking (within or across organizations) intended to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints.</td> <td>The OER World Map project</td></tr>
<tr> <td>services</td><td>A service is an online offer, which exists on a steady basis, and provides functionality and value related to OER to its users.</td> <td>repositories, aggregators, authoring tools, communication platforms</td></tr>
<tr> <td>events</td><td>An events is a gathering of people, which take place at a certain location (virtual or physical) at a certain time.</td><td>conferences, workshops, barcamps, moocs</td></tr>
</table>

There are many opportunities for future expansion of the model.

## What do I have to keep in mind when I set a lighthouse?
The Ljubjlana Action Plan highlights the need to identify models of good practice, which have proven to be sustainable ways to organize production, sharing and use of OER. We believe that learning from experiences made in other countries will be key for fast global mainstreaming of OER, so please consider setting some lighthouses.

Setting a lighthouse is pretty easy: When you are logged in, you simply click on the lighthouse symbol on the profile page of the entry you want to mark. Then you have to explain in the comment field what the community can learn from this particular example.

Please set lighthouses only in case you are not affiliated with the entry in any way!

## Where are the OER?
We believe that the discovery of individual OER has to be provided by search engine based services. The OER World Map facilitates the discovery of OER indirectly by providing qualified lists of OER services.

## What is an open license?
The widely accepted OER definitions by UNESCO and The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation require the use of a special ‘open’ license, which transforms a conventional educational resource into an open educational resource. Traditional copyright prescribes what can and can’t be done with materials that one has authored (or owns the rights to). Rather, it acknowledges and expresses these rights by recognising the author and prescribing specific conditions for use and reuse.


An open licence doesn’t undermine someone’s right to be recognised as the author of their work.  Rather, it recognises the author and sets out more specific conditions for use and reuse.

Depending on the specific license this allows for a range of behaviours known as the '5 Rs' of openness:

- **Retain** – the right to make, own, and control copies of the content
- **Reuse** – the right to use the content in a wide range of ways (e.g., in a class, in a study group, on a website, in a video)
- **Revise** – the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content itself (e.g., translate the content into another language)
- **Remix** – the right to combine the original or revised content with other open content to create something new (e.g., incorporate the content into a mashup)
- **Redistribute** – the right to share copies of the original content, your revisions, or your remixes with others (e.g., give a copy of the content to a friend)

A slightly different focus is provided by the [Open Definition](http://opendefinition.org/) which states that:
"Open data and content can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose"

Though there are many different open licenses available, [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) provides the by far most used open license family. We generally recommend the use of CC-BY or CC BY-SA licenses for OER. Both license meet the strict requirement of the open definition and also have been approved for free cultural works by Creative Commons. More information about the use of open content licenses can be found [here](https://www.unesco.de/fileadmin/medien/Dokumente/Kommunikation/Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Open_Content_Licences_web.pdf).

## Can I add services which provide non open resources to the map?
The most common OER definitions by UNESCO and by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation compulsory require the use of open licenses. "Free" or "gratis" resources (resources which are accessible without any cost on the internet but not openly licensed) are not OER according to these definitions. We take openness very serious since the idea of reusing and modifying resources is central to the concept of OER. By focusing on openly licensed material the OER World Map will provide real value to users, who are especially looking for reusable material.

Nevertheless, since the gratis offerings of today might become the openly licensed services of tomorrow, we don`t think that it makes sense to exclude non-open services dogmatically. Therefore, the OER World Map records and shares services providing material under a variety of licenses, with a minimum requirement that the material must be freely available online (“gratis”).

We do, however, take an active lead in highlighting the special benefits of open licenses. In order to do so, we currently provide search for openly licensed material. We are also working on developing an [openness indicator](https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues/237), which will be used in the future to visually convey information about the degree of openness of a service at one sight.

Projects are handled more flexibly than services. Many projects aim at goals related to Open Education in the wider sense and provide results which are valuable to the OER movement, even if they do not provide openly licensed materials. To avoid excluding valuable experiences, we believe that the OER World Map should be open to all projects which believe they make a contribution to the field of Open Education.

## Should MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) be added to the OER World Map?
This is an interesting question. The simple answer is "Yes!" But things are more complicated, if you look at it in more detail:

A criticism that has frequently been made is that many [MOOCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course) are not using openly licensed material (which arguably makes them "free" or “gratis” but not really "open"). As stated above, the World Map can also include gratis services and materials. This is true for MOOCs as well. But if a MOOC does not provide open resources, it will be classified accordingly using the "openness indicator" in the future.

One could alternatively argue that MOOCs are courses, which are using and providing OER (if open licenses are used), but that this does not make them OER themselves. Indeed it could be argued that MOOCs might be better classified as Open Educational Practices (OEP), than OER. Nevertheless, since there is an obvious connection between MOOCs and OER - and there is much interest in MOOCs - we believe that it makes sense to include MOOCs as well.

Concretely, the OER World Map offers the possibility of including MOOC providers as services and individual MOOCs as events. Our current collection strategy does not concentrate on MOOCs, but this  could potentially be a focus in the future.

## How will you use any information I share?
We believe data privacy is important. You can find information about our legal and privacy policy [here](https://oerworldmap.org/imprint). In order to assure that your data will be as safe as possible, we cooperate with a [lawyer specialized in data protection law](http://irights-law.de/team/jan-schallaboeck/). We follow a privacy by design approach, which makes sure that data privacy is taken into account from the beginning of the development process. This is true for all personal data provided to us. Nevertheless it has to be understood that all data published on the platform, including your personal profiles will be available to everyone as [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data).

## How can I contribute stories?
We invite you to share your OER story with the community and tell others about your OER activities! These could be OER projects or initiatives, Open Educational Practices like someone generating OER or teaching with OER, the development of guidelines & institutional policies on OER, new insights and research on OER, as well as the development or use of helpful infrastructure tools for OER. Please include a title and a text (no longer than 5000 characters) that describes the who, what, when, where, why and how of the activity. A photo connected to the story would also be great. Please note that stories will be published under [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).  If you have an OER story which you consider worth sharing, please register yourself and add it to the OER World Map. We are looking forward to hearing from you soon! We can also republish articles, blog post and other sources directly where these are available openly.

## Do you want to hear from students as well as educators?
Yes! We believe that the student voice is often not loud enough in discussions about OER. We are interested in hearing from anyone with a good story to tell about OER and how it has made a difference to them. This is especially true for stories from a learner perspective.

## What does it mean to become a country champion?
Country champions help to map the OER world by country – gathering data, assuring its quality and raising awareness of the project. Check out our [blog post](https://oerworldmap.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/what-does-it-mean-to-become-a-country-champion/) for more information about the country champion network. The map on the homepage shows where country champions are still needed. If you are interested in acting as champion for your country, please do not hesitate to [contact us](mailto:info@oerworldmap.org).

## Will the OER World Map be available in several languages?
The initial version of the website is beeing developed in English. Nevertheless, we believe that in the long run the site should be available in many languages and the system is prepared to support multilingualism. At the time being the platform supports data input in all major languages of the world and the system will show you data within the language chosen in your browser, if available. If you are interested in translating the website into your own language, please [contact us](mailto:info@oerworldmap.org).

## Why are countries displayed in different shades of green?
Countries with documented OER activity are displayed green. The more activity there is, the darker the colour. We call this mechanism “heat map”. The heat map is based right now on a very simple algorithm: the number of entries. We are thinking about refining the algorithm in the future (e.g. by representing the number of entries into relation to the number of inhabitants).

## How do I log in?

Please register and choose a personal password. The registration and login mask can be found in the upper right corner of the screen. The registration includes getting editing rights for the OER World Map.

## What do I have to consider before I enter new data?

Before you enter new data, please make sure, that the data set is not yet included in the world map. In order to do so, please use the search function of the world map.

## How can I add or modify entries?

As soon as you are logged in you can see a small orange button in the left upper corner with a plus sign on it. Clicking on it opens a pull down menu, which allows you to add following data types:

- Add Organization
- Add Service
- Add Project
- Add Story
- Add Event
- Add Publication
- Add Tool

More information on our data types can be found on the [FAQ page](https://oerworldmap.org/FAQ) under "What belongs on the OER World Map?"

Clicking on one of the fields will open the corresponding template. After entering the data, please make sure that you click on "save data" at the lower end of the template.

In order to modify an existing data set, please navigate to the data set and click on the pen icon in the upper right.

## Which data can I add or modify?

All registered users are allowed to input all data types for all countries. The "country champions" are not restricted to entries from "their" country. Actually we would like to encourage "country champions" to input data from other countries as well, since many countries are still lacking a world map champion!

All registered users can also add "stories". If you are pretty sure about the story you would like to publish, you can do so. But we also offer editorial support, so in doubt do not hesitate to contact us!

## Service, Organization or Project?

One lessons learned from our experience so far with mapping the world of OER is, that it is sometimes difficult to decide on the data type on an entry. Especially it can be hard to say if something is a service, an organization or a project.

The logical relation is as following: A service is an online offer that provides OER-related contents or functionalities (e.g. it helps finding, assessing, creating or publishing OER). The most important subsection of services are OER repositories. But there are many other kinds of services available (or thinkable) like authoring tools, search engines, community platforms, etc. A service is often run by a providing organization or in the case of grassroots by a person or a group of persons. Normally the service has been developed within a project, which is often run by the same organization, which later on provided the service. So if you aim at completeness, it can be necessary to record all three types.

Example: hbz drives a project called "OER World Map". The project aims at developing the service "OER World Map". Since the launch of Version 1.0 the service "OER World Map" is provided by hbz.

Nevertheless we believe that this is not always necessary. Rather it is preferable, to decide from case to case, which "degree of resolution" makes most sense. Indicators are:

We believe that services are the most important data types, because services provide direct value to users. So in most cases, it will be most important to record the service.

In most cases it will also make sense to capture the providing organization as well. This is especially true, if the organization is a major OER agent, which offers several services and/or runs multiple projects. As a rule, locations should be added to organizations. Once a service (or a project) is connected to an organization (via the "provider" field) the service is displayed on the map at the location of the providing organization.

Including the project makes special sense if either the project does not aim at delivering a service or has not delivered the service yet. It can also make sense to add a project, if you want to provide additional information, which is related specifically to the project, like its start and end date, special lessons learned, its budget or its funder.

If you find it hard to decide on how to model a special constellation, as always, please do not hesitate to contact us at info [at] oerworldmap.org!

## Should this service be put on the map?

Sometimes it is difficult to decide if a service should be put on the map. To support your decision ask yourself following questions:

- Are the available resources explicitly designed for education?
- How many resources are available?
- Does the site offer an search function for it`s resources? Is it possible to search for education specific qualities, e.g. related curricula?
- Are the materials openly licensed?
- Does the service have a name and a dedicated URL, or is is just a general portal with some resources on it?
- How up-to-date are the materials and the website? Does it look like the centre of a community, or does it look rather inactive?
  All this questions serve only as indicators. If in doubt, please contact us!

## How to add locations?

Simply type your address into the search field opening when you click on “Search Location …” and choose the best fitting suggestion from the pull-down menu. If you cannot find the exact address, try omitting the house number or enter only the city. Then drag the pin to the correct location and fill in the details below.

Entering a location for a service or a project is special: We believe that the real location of a service is the web. Therefore we argue, that a service has no location and that the pins on the map can only refer to the location of the organization, which is providing the service. *So the "regular" way to locate a service on the map is to add the providing organization and link the service to this organization via the "provider field", same for projects*.

Nevertheless we found that in some exceptional cases it is necessary to add a location directly to a service or a project. We therefore added an address field in the service and the project template as well. The address section of the service or project takes priority to the address of a linked organization. So if the address directly connected to a service or project is different to the address of a related organization, the address of the service or project will be displayed on the map. This allows to locate e.g. a project, which focuses on the use of OER in Africa, in Africa, even if the driving organizations are located in different parts of the world.

## How to add levels and subjects of education?

We are using ISCED levels and ISCED based fields of education to describe services. We believe that this will make it much easier for users to find the contents they need. Nevertheless it has to be admitted, that ISCED is a science of its own. Deciding on the levels and especially on the subjects of education can be time-consuming, especially if you are recording a service, which provides resources from different educational fields. In this case it can be helpful to start with the top level of the hierarchy, leaving out level 2-4. [More information on ISCED can be found here](http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Pages/international-standard-classification-of-education.aspx).

## How can I include formatting to texts?

The "description" field for organisations, services and projects as well as the "teaser" and "body" field for stories can be formatted using common html tags or markdown syntax.

## How do I provide feedback to the developing team?

If you are registered on Github, you can easily provide feedback by opening an issue at https://github.com/hbz/oerworldmap/issues/new. If you prefer contacting us by mail, we invite you to send your request to info [at] oerworldmap[dot]org.

## How can I delete entries?

At the moment users cannot delete entries. If you created a data set by error and want to delete it, please send us a mail to info [at]oerworldmap[dot]org.
